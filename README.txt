This is Chatter, a LAN chatting room built in Qt Creator 3.6.1(based on Qt 5.6.0)

This app using Client/Server model.

There is no account and password involved, but just user name.(And you can have same user name with others, so have fun with it:-))

You can talk and send files but the receiving directory can not be changed, and it wll always be current directory.

All in all this is just a school assignment.
